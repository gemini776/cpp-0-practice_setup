Practice Repository to learn github flow and functions


I will be using the cpp-#- preamble to designate projects as I learn C++. My goal is to become competent at programming and using git version control. I will be doing many different tutorials and video lessons so I decided to create a repository for each project I build. I desire to build a strong portfolio that shows growth in my programming skills and abilities.
